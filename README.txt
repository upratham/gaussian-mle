# Maximum Likelihood Estimation with Gaussian Distribution

This repository demonstrates how to perform **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** using Gaussian (Normal) distributions. 
The project includes both data and a Jupyter Notebook with implementation, visualizations, and explanations.

## 📂 Repository Contents

- **MLE_Gaussian.csv**  
  Sample dataset used for estimation and analysis.

- **Gaussian_MLE.ipynb**  
  Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step implementation of MLE for Gaussian distribution.  
  Includes:
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - Visualization of Gaussian distribution
  - Derivation and implementation of MLE
  - Parameter estimation (mean and variance)
  - Results and interpretation
